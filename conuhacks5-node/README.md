## Requirements

This project requires the latest stable versions of: 

- Node
- NPM 

## Getting started.

Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies for the application to run. You will only need to install this once cloning this project. You 
will see that it generates a folder called `node_modules` where you dependencies are resided locally. You can then start
modifying the routes in the `src/index.js` file and  launch the server with `npm start`. Every time you make a change, you will need
to kill and restart the server with the same command again. If you are tired of doing that you may use tools like 
[nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to restart the server for you on file changes.
