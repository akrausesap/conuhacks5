# PHP with Slim

PHP is one of the widely popular language of the web. This project was made with the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/),
a super simple library to handle http routing.

## Requirements

This project requires the latest stable versions of:

- Composer
- PHP

## Getting Started

Run `composer install` to install dependencies. You will only need to install this once cloning this project. You 
will see that it generates a folder called `vendor` where you dependencies are resided locally. You can then start
modifying the routes in the `public/index.php` file and launch the server with `composer start`.
